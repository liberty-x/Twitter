## Who?

Liberty-X, a project team in the 6th iteration of the Founders & Coders academy. Members: Justen Barget, Rachel Black, Huw Davies and Ruth Uwemedimo.

## What?

LX Twit will be a simple twitter-esque page to post 'tweets' on. We are hosting this on Heroku. We are conducting this project during our 4th week of the course.

## Why?

We are experimenting with the use of Redis as our backend database. Our users' 'tweets' will be stored there and displayed on our page.
