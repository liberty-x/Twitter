## Who?

Liberty-X, a project team in the 6th iteration of the Founders & Coders academy. Members: Justen Barget, Rachel Black, Huw Davies and Ruth Uwemedimo.

## What?

LX Twit will be a simple twitter-esque page to post 'tweets' on. We are hosting this on Heroku. We are conducting this project during our 4th week of the course.

## Why?

We are experimenting with the use of Redis as our backend database. Our users' 'tweets' will be stored there and displayed on our page.

### Functionality

Users input their username and tweet in a form box that will then appear below. Through using local storage, they and only they will be able to delete their own tweets.

### Depedencies

* Redis (database)
* QUnit (frontend testing)
* Tape (backend testing)
* Shot (backend testing)

### Testing

Link [here]() to our frontend tests, conducted with QUnit.

For backend testing, please download our repo and run our backend.js file, having used the command ``npm install`` to download our dependencies shown above.
